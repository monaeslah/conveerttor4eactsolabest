In addition to its high strength and resistance, marbles are available in wide range of colors. Back to the history, marble is widely used as a building material or sculpture in ancient Iran and Greece. Pure marble comes in white color but they are available in other colors due to existence of colorful minerals. In texture, marble is a fine-grained rock with a uniform granular surface. Marbles are categorized in chemical sedimentary group in terms of geology and are mostly created as a result of chemical and biochemical processes to algae, corals and calcite sediments. The low porosity of marbles, causes low water absorption. Marbles have more density and resistance in comparison with Travertine and are more convenient to be polished. Marbles are one of the most important Iranian stones and the total reservation reach to more than 165.2 Millions of Tons. To summarize, recrystallization of Limestone creates a modified stone named Marble.
